My work consists of several folders:
1.-3.- Case Studies 1-3 - Work for peer-graded and staff-graded assignments. Consists of studying an application then applying changes to it.
4. Final Project - Work and Documentation for my final project that formed my grade to pass - a data parsing and visualisation web application.

_Note: To run any application, please use a private server or simply the Go Live option in VS Code, opening up the index.html leads to incomplete results on several projects._
